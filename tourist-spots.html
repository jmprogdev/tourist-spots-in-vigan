                <h3>Calle Crisologo</h3>
                <p>This is Vigan's most iconic street, lined with ancestral houses from
                    the Spanish colonial era. What to do here is take a walk or, better yet,
                    a kalesa ride, especially at night when the street lamps cast a warm, vintage glow.</p>
                <h4>History & Trivia</h4>
                <p>The houses are famous for their bahay na bato architecture, combining stone ground floors
                    and wooden upper floors with sliding windows made of capiz shells. It is said that the 
                    street was saved from destruction during World War II because a Japanese officer married
                    to a local woman intervened, preserving the priceless heritage.</p>

                    government and religious buildings like the Vigan Cathedral and the Provincial Capitol. 
                    The main attraction here is the Dancing Fountain Show held in the evening, show of lights, water, and music.</p>
                <h4>History & Trivia</h4>
                <p>Plaza Salcedo is the historical heart of Vigan, named for city founder Juan de Salcedo. It is the central square 
                    surrounded by the Vigan Cathedral and the Provincial Capitol. Its most notable historical event was the execution
                    of the revolutionary heroine Gabriela Silang in 1763. A key piece of trivia is its large pool, which was originally 
                    installed as a firefighting water reservoir but is now famous for hosting the nightly Dancing Fountain Show.</p>
